I've seen the devil
Down Sunset
In every place
In every face
Yeah, uh 
Tell me, do you see her? (Yeah; uh) She's livin' her life (Uh)
Even if she acts like she don't want the limelight (Uh, yeah; uh, uh)
But if you knew her (Yeah-yeah; uh), she lives a lie
She calls the paparazzi, then she acts surprised
Oh
[Pre-Chorus: The Weeknd]
Oh-oh-oh-oh, I know what she needs (Oh-oh; uh)
She just want the fame, I know what shе fiends (Oh-oh; uh, yeah)
Give hеr a little taste, runnin' back to me (Oh-oh; uh)
Put it in her veins, pray her soul to keep, ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh, every night (Every night; uh) she prays to the sky
Flashin' lights is all she ever wants to see
[Chorus: The Weeknd]
Beggin' on her knees to be popular
That's her dream, to be popular (Ha)
Kill anyone to be popular (Hm)
Sell her soul to be popular (Popular)
Just to be popular (Uh-huh)
Everybody scream 'cause she popular (Ha)
She mainstream 'cause she popular
Never be free 'cause she popular
